TASK : 3.IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL
This project focuses on building an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras as part of the CodTech Machine Learning internship. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 color images across 10 distinct categories such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, and others. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for final classification. The input data is normalized to improve training efficiency, and the model is trained for 10 epochs with validation on a test dataset. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics, which are visualized through plots. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning for computer vision tasks and highlights how CNNs can effectively classify images based on their features.
